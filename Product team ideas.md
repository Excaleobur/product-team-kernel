# New ideas for the Product Team

This is the first year we are running a QMIND product team which gives us lots of flexibility to take it in any direction we like. Our focus is simply to support the design teams develop their projects into something usable for an the end-user. Please append to this list any ideas you may have for the product team. There are no bad ideas; take it anywhere you like.

Feel free to also comment on others ideas:
